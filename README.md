## About
RTS prototype which later finalized into a game that is called [Leave No One Behind (available on steam)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1635350/Leave_No_One_Behind_Ia_Drang/). 

This whole project was made by me with only exception being the *Helicopter.cs* which was written by my colleague.

I've worked on this project from 2019 till 2020. Then i've switched project and the rest of the team finished and released the game.

This doesn't exactly reflect my coding capabilities, since i see many unindial desicions throught the whole architecture. This should reflect that i'm flexible on trying new things and figuring out the best way how to move forward. This architecture was simple to extend, but hard to maintain. 

Unit and Soldier classes are not ideally implemented. It's hard to add more behaviours to them and overall it is hard to realize system/abbility interacts with what. A rewrite would very much focus on a system that would easily stack abbilities.
